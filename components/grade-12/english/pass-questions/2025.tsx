      <Paragraph>
        <p className="pl-0">
          Air pollution can be defined as ‘the introduction of harmful
          substances into the air’. It occurs due to human activities such as
          fuel burning, logging, farming, mining, manufacturing, and
          construction of roads and buildings. It can also be caused by natural
          events such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions. All these sources of
          air pollution result in a rise in the amount of greenhouse gases. This
          leads to an increase in global temperature, which brings about many
          environmental problems such as floods, acid rain and ozone depletion.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the rise in global temperature, the ice at the poles melts and
          sea levels rise, flooding many coastal regions and leading to loss of
          property and life. Acid rain is one of the consequences of air
          pollution. It occurs when smoke and fumes from traffic and factories
          mix with the water vapour in the atmosphere. When this mixture falls
          back to the ground, it harms not only humans and wildlife but also
          buildings. The ozone layer is part of the earth’s atmosphere that
          protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Ozone
          depletion occurs when some greenhouse gases like CFCs are released
          into the atmosphere. Moreover, air pollutants can cause many severe
          health problems such as eye irritation, allergies, asthma and lung
          cancer.

      <Paragraph>
        <p className="pl-0">
          Research indicates that sleep needs vary among individuals and age
          groups. Two factors that play a major role in the amount required for
          productivity and happiness are basal sleep need and sleep debt. Basal
          sleep need is the amount required for optimal performance and sleep
          debt is the cumulative loss from poor habits or interruptions. Healthy
          adults generally need seven to eight hours of sleep. though sleep debt
          may still cause fatigue. Lack of sleep can impair productivity,
          memory, and health, potentially leading to diabetes, heart disease,
          and increased mortality. Oversleeping’s impact is often linked with
          depression and low socioeconomic status. To determine personal sleep
          needs, you should observe your own productivity and alertness and the
          feeling after different amounts of sleep. There are a few things you
          can do to improve your quality of sleep: establishing a consistent
          sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, creating a
          comfortable sleep environment, and avoiding electronics in bed.
          General sleep guidelines suggest varying hours based on age: 12-18 for
          newborns, 14-15 for infants, 12-14 for toddlers, 11-13 for
          preschoolers, 10-11 for school-aged children, 8.59.25 for teens, and
          7-9 for adults. Prioritizing sleep can enhance mood and productivity.

        <p className="pl-0">
          The ill effects of light pollution are many. For instance, light that
          is too bright can damage our vision; so does insufficient light. A
          bright light has been found to cause sleep disorders such as sleep
          deprivation, which in turn causes stress, headaches and increasing
          anxiety. Bright artificial night light has been found to upset the
          food-hunting pattern of many nocturnal and crepuscular creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          To minimise the effects of environmental pollution, what should we do?
          What are the possible solutions to some environmental problems that
          come about as a result of pollution? We must reduce our use of fossil
          fuels and promote the use of friendly sources of energy, like the sun,
          wind and water. Although it is impossible to shut down factories,
          there should be stricter laws to prevent them from polluting the
          environment. Forests must be protected because trees take in carbon
          dioxide. Fewer fertilisers and pesticides should be used in
          agriculture. We should also try to produce less waste, and recycle
          lots of things that we throw away. And we should be judicious in using
          light during the night as well as day. If we do not do something to
          combat pollution: a hazard to our environment, we will all be losers -
          with dire consequences to face.

      <Paragraph>
        <p className="pl-0">
          Advertisements are a core part of marketing since they significantly
          influence the shopping habits of people. This is especially true with
          children, and marketing experts are becoming more and more aware of
          this fact. Many television advertisements for children are short and
          fun, usually in the form of imaginative cartoons. However, the problem
          is that many of the foodstuffs marketed to children are the least
          nutritious ones. They contain more fat, salt, and sugar than healthier
          options, and many packages include various types of incentives from
          toys, unique boxes to interactive websites to attract children.
          Unfortunately, children do not think as critically as adults when they
          see advertisements on television, and they do not realize that the
          advertisements are meant to persuade them or their parents to spend
          money on the product or service.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the main reasons why many countries have strict restrictions
          on advertisements aimed at children. Some countries ban such
          advertisements altogether, while other countries limit the duration
          that they can appear on television or the products that can be
          displayed. Nevertheless, a few countries argue that advertisements
          help children develop the ability to think before they buy things when
          they grow up, and to know when they are being persuaded

      <Paragraph>
        <p>
          According to psychologists, emotional well-being is defined as ‘the
          ability to recognize our emotions, manage them and produce positive
          feelings or thoughts’. In other words, people with emotional wellness
          are aware of their own emotions and can deal with difficult problems
          by using some effective strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In daily life, we are more likely to experience negative emotions than
          positive ones. When we get exposed to stressful situations, it is
          easier for us to get disappointed, worried, or distressed, especially
          if we are emotionally unhealthy. Als, we blame others or criticize
          them when something bad or unkind happens to us. If our distress lasts
          much longer, our emotional well-being is badly affected. When our
          wants or needs are not fulfilled, we feel depressed, distressed or
          frustrated. As a result, we can neither eat nor sleep well, and we
          cannot concentrate fully on anything. If negative emotions become
          chronic or overwhelming, we will be faced with problems, like losing
          our loved ones. Emotional well-being typically brings pleasant
          feelings such as excitement, happiness and love. This does not mean
          that it is free from sadness and anxiety. Emotionally healthy people
          also experience negative feelings such as anxiety, rage, doubt or
          sadness. However, they can cope with life’s challenges, and they can
          even manage to bounce back after having been defeated. Thus, emotional
          well-being has a big role to play in seeking happiness and life
          satisfaction.

      <Paragraph>
        <p>
          According to psychologists, emotional well-being is defined as ‘the
          ability to recognize our emotions, manage them and produce positive
          feelings or thoughts’. In other words, people with emotional wellness
          are aware of their own emotions and can deal with difficult problems
          by using some effective strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In daily life, we are more likely to experience negative emotions than
          positive ones. When we get exposed to stressful situations, it is
          easier for us to get disappointed, worried, or distressed, especially
          if we are emotionally unhealthy. Als, we blame others or criticize
          them when something bad or unkind happens to us. If our distress lasts
          much longer, our emotional well-being is badly affected. When our
          wants or needs are not fulfilled, we feel depressed, distressed or
          frustrated. As a result, we can neither eat nor sleep well, and we
          cannot concentrate fully on anything. If negative emotions become
          chronic or overwhelming, we will be faced with problems, like losing
          our loved ones. Emotional well-being typically brings pleasant
          feelings such as excitement, happiness and love. This does not mean
          that it is free from sadness and anxiety. Emotionally healthy people
          also experience negative feelings such as anxiety, rage, doubt or
          sadness. However, they can cope with life’s challenges, and they can
          even manage to bounce back after having been defeated. Thus, emotional
          well-being has a big role to play in seeking happiness and life
          satisfaction.

      <Paragraph>
        <p>
          According to psychologists, emotional well-being is defined as ‘the
          ability to recognize our emotions, manage them and produce positive
          feelings or thoughts’. In other words, people with emotional wellness
          are aware of their own emotions and can deal with difficult problems
          by using some effective strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In daily life, we are more likely to experience negative emotions than
          positive ones. When we get exposed to stressful situations, it is
          easier for us to get disappointed, worried, or distressed, especially
          if we are emotionally unhealthy. Als, we blame others or criticize
          them when something bad or unkind happens to us. If our distress lasts
          much longer, our emotional well-being is badly affected. When our
          wants or needs are not fulfilled, we feel depressed, distressed or
          frustrated. As a result, we can neither eat nor sleep well, and we
          cannot concentrate fully on anything. If negative emotions become
          chronic or overwhelming, we will be faced with problems, like losing
          our loved ones. Emotional well-being typically brings pleasant
          feelings such as excitement, happiness and love. This does not mean
          that it is free from sadness and anxiety. Emotionally healthy people
          also experience negative feelings such as anxiety, rage, doubt or
          sadness. However, they can cope with life’s challenges, and they can
          even manage to bounce back after having been defeated. Thus, emotional
          well-being has a big role to play in seeking happiness and life
          satisfaction.

        <p className="pl-0">
          So far, Al scientists have achieved success in creating Al-powered
          machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech and vision. A wide range
          of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by Al
          scientists. Examples of Al technology can be seen in our daily life.
          When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile (phone), we
          notice pop-up messages suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting
          what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are
          quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the
          computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called
          "text editor" helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we
          also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such times, these mistakes are
          automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the
          autocorrection feature of a computer software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the
          security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and
          security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect
          criminals, and protect our homes, In the transportation sector,
          self-driving cars, or driverless cars powered by AI technology are
          becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as
          well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was difficult for us
          to find a location in a big city. Now, the Google Maps and GPS
          Navigation Apps. installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar
          place just by following the directions.

          So far, Al scientists have achieved success in creating Al-powered
          machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech and vision. A wide range
          of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by Al
          scientists. Examples of Al technology can be seen in our daily life.
          When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile (phone), we
          notice pop-up messages suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting
          what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are
          quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the
          computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called
          "text editor" helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we
          also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such times, these mistakes are
          automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the
          autocorrection feature of a computer software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the
          security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and
          security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect
          criminals, and protect our homes, In the transportation sector,
          self-driving cars, or driverless cars powered by AI technology are
          becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as
          well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was difficult for us
          to find a location in a big city. Now, the Google Maps and GPS
          Navigation Apps. installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar
          place just by following the directions.

          So far, Al scientists have achieved success in creating Al-powered
          machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech and vision. A wide range
          of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by Al
          scientists. Examples of Al technology can be seen in our daily life.
          When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile (phone), we
          notice pop-up messages suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting
          what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are
          quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the
          computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called
          "text editor" helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we
          also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such times, these mistakes are
          automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the
          autocorrection feature of a computer software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the
          security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and
          security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect
          criminals, and protect our homes, In the transportation sector,
          self-driving cars, or driverless cars powered by AI technology are
          becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as
          well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was difficult for us
          to find a location in a big city. Now, the Google Maps and GPS
          Navigation Apps. installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar
          place just by following the directions.

          So far, Al scientists have achieved success in creating Al-powered
          machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech and vision. A wide range
          of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by Al
          scientists. Examples of Al technology can be seen in our daily life.
          When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile (phone), we
          notice pop-up messages suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting
          what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are
          quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the
          computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called
          "text editor" helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we
          also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such times, these mistakes are
          automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the
          autocorrection feature of a computer software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the
          security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and
          security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect
          criminals, and protect our homes, In the transportation sector,
          self-driving cars, or driverless cars powered by AI technology are
          becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as
          well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was difficult for us
          to find a location in a big city. Now, the Google Maps and GPS
          Navigation Apps. installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar
          place just by following the directions.

        <p className="pl-0">
          So far, Al scientists have achieved success in creating Al-powered
          machines and gadgets with reasoning, speech and vision. A wide range
          of machines, devices, and tools powered by AI have been invented by Al
          scientists. Examples of Al technology can be seen in our daily life.
          When we are typing a text on a computer or on a mobile (phone), we
          notice pop-up messages suddenly appearing on the screen, suggesting
          what we should write next. Most of the time, these suggestions are
          quite the same as what we are going to write. It seems that the
          computer can read our minds. This is how a computer programme called
          "text editor" helps us with word processing. While typing a text, we
          also tend to make spelling mistakes. At such times, these mistakes are
          automatically corrected by the computer. This is what we call the
          autocorrection feature of a computer software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have more examples of AI technology in various sectors. In the
          security and surveillance sector, facial recognition systems and
          security cameras help the police find missing persons, detect
          criminals, and protect our homes, In the transportation sector,
          self-driving cars, or driverless cars powered by AI technology are
          becoming more and more popular because they can reduce driver error as
          well as the number of accidents. In the past, it was difficult for us
          to find a location in a big city. Now, the Google Maps and GPS
          Navigation Apps. installed on our mobiles help us get to an unfamiliar
          place just by following the directions.
