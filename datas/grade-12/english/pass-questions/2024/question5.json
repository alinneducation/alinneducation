It occurs due to human activities such as fuel burning, logging, farming, mining, manufacturing, and construction of roads and buildings. It can also be caused by natural events such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions. All these sources of air pollution result in a rise in the amount of greenhouse gases. This leads to an increase in global temperature, which brings about many environmental problems such as floods, acid rain and ozone depletion. </p> <p> With the rise in global temperature, the ice at the poles melts and sea levels rise, flooding many coastal regions and leading to loss of property and life. Acid rain is one of the consequences of air pollution. It occurs when smoke and fumes from traffic and factories mix with the water vapour in the atmosphere. When this mixture falls back to the ground, it harms not only humans and wildlife but also buildings. The ozone layer is part of the earth’s atmosphere that protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Ozone depletion occurs when some greenhouse gases like CFCs are released into the atmosphere. Moreover, air pollutants can cause many severe health problems such as eye irritation, allergies, asthma and lung cancer.</p>",

What are the possible solutions to some environmental problems that come about as a result of pollution? We must reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote the use of friendly sources of energy, like the sun, wind and water. Although it is impossible to shut down factories, there should be stricter laws to prevent them from polluting the environment. Forests must be protected because trees take in carbon dioxide. Fewer fertilisers and pesticides should be used in agriculture. We should also try to produce less waste, and recycle lots of things that we throw away. And we should be judicious in using light during the night as well as day. If we do not do something to combat pollution: a hazard to our environment, we will all be losers - with dire consequences to face.</p>",

In other words, people with emotional wellness are aware of their own emotions and can deal with difficult problems by using some effective strategies.</p><p>In daily life, we are more likely to experience negative emotions than positive ones. When we get exposed to stressful situations, it is easier for us to get disappointed, worried, or distressed, especially if we are emotionally unhealthy. Als, we blame others or criticize them when something bad or unkind happens to us. If our distress lasts much longer, our emotional well-being is badly affected. When our wants or needs are not fulfilled, we feel depressed, distressed or frustrated. As a result, we can neither eat nor sleep well, and we cannot concentrate fully on anything. If negative emotions become chronic or overwhelming, we will be faced with problems, like losing our loved ones. Emotional well-being typically brings pleasant feelings such as excitement, happiness and love. This does not mean that it is free from sadness and anxiety. Emotionally healthy people also experience negative feelings such as anxiety, rage, doubt or sadness. However, they can cope with life’s challenges, and they can even manage to bounce back after having been defeated. Thus, emotional well-being has a big role to play in seeking happiness and life satisfaction.</p>",
